description: Semantic search over notes (MEMORY.md, memory/*.md), chat log, and filesystem index. When user ran "cowcode index --source filesystem", use memory_search for "what files do I have?" with query like "directory contents". Tools: memory_search, memory_get, memory_save. See SKILL.md.

# Memory

Semantic search over your **notes** (`MEMORY.md`, `memory/*.md`) and optional **search log** (chat history). Use memory_search for notes whenever relevant. You can narrow by **date range** (e.g. "What did I note last week?") so results are filtered by when the note was written, not only by semantic match.

**Search log (built-in)** — Chat is stored in `workspace/chat-log/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` and can be searched. **Only use memory_search to search chat history when the user explicitly asks**, e.g. "what did we talk about yesterday?", "search my logs", "last time we chatted", "what did I ask you before?", "our previous conversation". Do not search logs for general queries; only when the user clearly mentions past conversations, yesterday, or logs.

**Filesystem index** — If the user has run `cowcode index --source filesystem`, the same memory index contains **directory listings** (one chunk per directory). Results can have path `filesystem/` or `filesystem/rel/path` and snippet text like "Directory: /path\nContents: file1, file2, subdir/, ...". When the user asks "what files do I have?", "list my files", "what's in my workspace?", "search my memory for files", use **memory_search** with a query that matches directory/listings, e.g. "directory contents", "list of files and folders", "files and directories". Then report the path and snippet from any results whose path starts with `filesystem/` — the snippet is the directory listing. Do not use memory_get for paths starting with `filesystem/` (only notes and chat-log paths are readable that way).

**Auto-indexing** — Notes (MEMORY.md, memory/*.md) and chat-log files are synced when you run memory_search. No manual "moo index" needed.

## Tools (pass `tool` in arguments: "memory_search", "memory_get", or "memory_save")

- **memory_search** — Set `tool: "memory_search"`, `query` (required). Optional: `maxResults`, `minScore`, `date`, **`dateFrom`**, **`dateTo`**, **`dateRange`**. Searches notes (and chat when the user asks about past conversations). **Date range** — When the user asks for notes or activity in a time window (e.g. "What did I note last week?", "notes from February", "yesterday's notes"), set **`dateFrom`** and **`dateTo`** as `YYYY-MM-DD`, or use **`dateRange`**: `"yesterday"`, `"last_week"` / `"last_7_days"`, or `"last_month"`. Results are restricted to chunks whose date falls in that range (not only semantic match). For "yesterday" chat, `date: "yesterday"` still includes that day's chat-log; combining with `dateRange: "yesterday"` narrows both notes and chat to that day. Returns snippets with path and line range (paths may be `MEMORY.md`, `memory/2025-02-15.md`, `chat-log/2025-02-16.jsonl`, or `filesystem/` / `filesystem/rel/path` for directory listings). Only search chat when the user explicitly mentions it.
- **memory_get** — Set `tool: "memory_get"`, `path` (required, from memory_search). Optional: `from`, `lines`. Read a snippet by path (including chat-log/*.jsonl when the user explicitly asked about past conversations).
- **memory_save** — Set `tool: "memory_save"`, `text` (required): the note to save. Optional: `file` (default: `MEMORY.md`; use `memory/notes.md` or any `.md` path inside the workspace). Appends the note with today's date prefix and immediately re-indexes so it is searchable at once. Use when the user says "remember that…", "note this down", "save this for later", "add to my notes", etc.

## Config

- Add `"memory"` to `skills.enabled`. Embedding: if an OpenAI key is available (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY` or an OpenAI model in LLM config), OpenAI is used; otherwise local (Ollama, `nomic-embed-text`) is used. You can override with `memory.embedding` in config.
- Workspace: `~/.cowcode/workspace/`. Create `MEMORY.md` and optionally `memory/*.md`. Chat logs live in `workspace/chat-log/` and are created automatically.
